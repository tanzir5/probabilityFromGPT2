"rewrite the text in a different style: 
His ninth birthday found him a pale, thin child, diminutive in stature, and decidedly small in circumference, but possessed of a good sturdy spirit, which was not broken by the policy of the officials who tried to get as much work out of the paupers as possible, and to keep them on as scant a supply of food as would sustain life.","He was too big a coward to rob any one but little children who had been sent to the shop to buy something, so Fagin had given him spying work to do, and in this, being by nature a sneak, he proved very successful."
"rewrite the text in a different style: 
The boys were fed in a large stone hall, with a copper at one end, out of which the gruel was ladled at meal-times.","They ate in a great stone hall, in one end of which stood the big copper of gruel which Mr. Bumble ladled out."
"rewrite the text in a different style: Of this festive composition each boy had one porringer, and no more--except on occasions of great public rejoicing, when he had two ounces and a quarter of bread besides.","
The boys had nothing but thin gruel for their meals, with an onion twice a week and half a roll on Sundays."
rewrite the text in a different style: The bowls never wanted washing.,"Each boy got only one helping, and the bowls never needed washing, because, when the meal was through, there was not a drop of gruel left in them."

"rewrite the text in a different style: 
Boys have generally excellent appetites.","
One day they felt so terribly hungry that one of the biggest boys said unless he got another helping of gruel he was afraid he would have to eat the boy who slept next him."
"rewrite the text in a different style: Oliver Twist and his companions suffered the tortures of slow starvation for three months: at last they got so voracious and wild that one boy hinted darkly that unless he had another basin of gruel a day, he was afraid he might some night happen to eat the boy who slept next him.","
As for Mr. and Mrs. Bumble, they, of course, lost their positions, and sank from bad to worse till they finally became paupers and were sent to the very same poorhouse where they had tortured little Oliver Twist."

The master aimed a blow at Oliver's head with the ladle; pinioned him in his arms; and shrieked for the beadle, and when that gentleman appeared, an animated discussion took place.","

Mr. Sowerberry, the parish undertaker, finally applied for the prize, and carried Oliver away with him, which, for the poor boy, was a matter of falling from the frying pan into the fire, and in his short career as undertaker's assistant he even sighed for the workhouse,--miserable as his life there had been.","The undertaker sent for Mr. Bumble, and between them they flogged him till he could hardly stand and sent him to bed without anything to eat."

"rewrite the text in a different style: Crimson with fury, Oliver started up, seized Noah by the throat, shook him till his teeth chattered, and then with one heavy blow, felled him to the ground.","The people were all convinced at this, and when Sikes struck Oliver and seized him by the collar they said, ""Serves him right!"""
"rewrite the text in a different style: 
This brought about a violent scene, for Noah accused Oliver of attempting to murder him, and Mrs. Sowerberry, the maid, and the beadle,--who had been hastily summoned,--agreed that Oliver was a hardened wretch, only fit for confinement, and he was accordingly placed in the cellar, till the undertaker came in, when he was dragged out again to have the story retold.",And so Oliver found himself dragged away from Mr. Brownlow to the filthy house where lived Fagin.
"rewrite the text in a different style: To do Mr. Sowerberry justice, he would have been kindly disposed towards Oliver, but for the prejudice of his wife against the boy.","Then, to make an example of him, a notice was pasted on the gate of the workhouse offering a reward to anybody who would take poor Oliver away and do what he liked with him."
